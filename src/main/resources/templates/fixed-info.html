                COST EFFECTIVE TOW BAR SYSTEM FOR REGULAR USE
            </h3>
            <p>
                The fixed towbar is the most affordable towbar system and is ideal for regular use.
                Westfalia-Automotive offer two different types of fixed towbar, the swan neck and flange.
            </p>

            <h3 class="fw-bold">
                SWAN NECK TOWBAR
            </h3>
            <p>The swan neck towbar is the most common type of towbar used across Europe. With the swan neck the tow
                ball and the neck form one piece of the towbar. This type of towbar is becoming more and more
                popular in the UK due to the appearance of the towbar looking neater and with it having a slimmer
                profile to the flange towbar it is less likely to trigger parking sensors.</p>
            <p>If you want to tow and attach a cycle carrier at the same time, the swan neck towbar will not be for
                you. Be careful though, you must add together the weight of the bikes and the nose weight of the
                trailer, the two added together should not exceed the maximum nose weight stated by the vehicle
                manufacturer.</p>
            <p>The swan neck towbar can also be used with an ALKO or BPW stabiliser without the need for
                modification. An additional towball will have to be purchased that is ALKO compatible if you are
                fitting a flange towball. If you are using a stabiliser with built in friction pads it is essential
                that all paint and grease is removed from the towball prior to use.</p>

            <h3 class="fw-bold">
                FLANGE TOWBAR
            </h3>
            <p>The flange towbar was for many years the only type of towbar manufactured in the UK. The tow ball is
                bolted to the towbar with either two bolts or four bolts. The flange is a versatile towbar which can
                be used with towball mounted accessories eg cycle carriers, bumper protectors and all types of
                stabilisers, all mounted between the towbar and ball. The flange towbar is non-removable.</p>
            <p>If you want to tow and attach a cycle carrier at the same time, the flange towbar will be for you. Be
                careful though, you must add together the weight of the bikes and the nose weight of the trailer,
                the two added together should not exceed the maximum nose weight stated by the vehicle manufacturer.
            </p>
            <p>The flange towbar can also be used with an ALKO or BPW stabiliser without the need for modification.
                An additional towball will have to be purchased that is ALKO compatible. If you are using a
                stabiliser with built in friction pads it is essential that all paint and grease is removed from the
                towball prior to use.</p>
